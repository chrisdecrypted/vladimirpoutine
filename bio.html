From simple three chord punk with 70s roots to modern styles with complex arrangements. Justin's boomy vocal range is reminisicent of early 80s groups like Joy Division or Echo and the Bunnymen. The spirit of Punk radiates through all their music. Themes of social justice as well as the politics of the personal are explored in the lyrics.
